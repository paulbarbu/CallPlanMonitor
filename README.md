Call Plan Monitor
=================

An Android application that watches how much I talk on the phone with people in other networks.
When a certain threshold is reached, I get a notification warning me that I might go over my plan.
This helps me avoid paying over my plan.

Note: This is a very rigid application, made specifically for my needs, for my carrier, for my plan.
